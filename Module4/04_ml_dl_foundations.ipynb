   "source": "## Part 10 — LLMs: How Language Models Work (and Why They Hallucinate)\n\nNow that you understand ML/DL fundamentals, let's see how they apply to **Large Language Models (LLMs)** like GPT and Claude.\n\n### How LLMs Are Trained\n\nLLMs learn through **self-supervised learning** on massive text datasets:\n\n1. **Training data**: Billions of documents from the internet, books, code\n2. **Task**: Predict the next word (token) given previous words\n3. **Process**: Same gradient descent we learned—adjust weights to reduce prediction error\n\n```\nInput:  \"The capital of France is ___\"\nTarget: \"Paris\"\n\nModel predicts → Calculates loss → Backpropagation → Updates weights\n```\n\n### Next-Token Prediction\n\nLLMs don't \"understand\" like humans. They learn **statistical patterns**:\n\n| What LLM sees | What it learns |\n|---------------|----------------|\n| \"The sky is ___\" | \"blue\" often follows |\n| \"Once upon a ___\" | \"time\" often follows |\n| \"SELECT * FROM ___\" | Table names often follow |\n\n**Key insight**: LLMs are pattern completion machines. They predict what text *typically* follows, based on training data.\n\n### Why Hallucinations Are Expected\n\n**Hallucination** = LLM produces confident-sounding but incorrect information.\n\nThis isn't a bug—it's a direct consequence of how LLMs work:\n\n| ML Concept | LLM Behavior |\n|------------|--------------|\n| Pattern completion | Generates plausible-sounding text even when facts are wrong |\n| Training data bias | Repeats errors or biases present in training data |\n| No fact-checking | Model doesn't verify claims—just predicts likely text |\n| Over-generalisation | Applies patterns to situations where they don't apply |\n\n**Example**: If asked about a fictional event, an LLM might generate a detailed, confident-sounding description—because that's what text about events *typically looks like*.\n\n### Why This Matters for Enterprise\n\nIn banking and enterprise settings, hallucinations are a serious risk:\n\n- **Compliance**: LLM might cite non-existent regulations\n- **Financial advice**: LLM might invent statistics or market data\n- **Legal**: LLM might fabricate case law (this has happened!)\n- **Reputation**: Incorrect information damages trust\n\n### The Solution: Grounding and RAG\n\n**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** mitigates hallucinations by:\n\n1. **Retrieving** relevant documents from a trusted knowledge base\n2. **Providing** these documents as context to the LLM\n3. **Grounding** the response in actual evidence\n\n```\nWITHOUT RAG:\nUser question → LLM → Potentially hallucinated answer\n\nWITH RAG:\nUser question → Search knowledge base → Retrieve relevant docs \n             → LLM + docs → Answer grounded in evidence\n```\n\n*Think of it as giving the hiker (model) a map and signposts, rather than relying only on memory of terrain from past walks.*\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- LLMs are pattern completion machines, not knowledge databases\n- Hallucinations are expected behavior, not bugs\n- Training data quality directly affects output quality\n- Enterprise use requires grounding (RAG) and human oversight\n- Never trust LLM outputs for facts without verification",
